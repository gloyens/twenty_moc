# Twenty Minutes of Crap
### Live website: http://twenty-moc.herokuapp.com/

## What is this project?
This is a Rails app designed to help authors improve their writing skills and break through writer's block. It's based on the idea that the best way to improve one's writing is to just start writing, even if it's not perfect at first.

## Aim
The aim of this website was to create a fully-functioning Rails app by myself, in order to deepen my understanding. This app is fairly simple, using no database, API or authentication (although the architecture is in place), but it did give me a much better understanding of JavaScript and Stimulus in particular. This small app sets the stage for me to branch out further into apps that are closer in complexity to [Nano](https://github.com/kiran-blip/nano).

## How it works
>*Whenever you’re ready, you can start typing to begin the timer. The backspace key is disabled by default, but you can choose to allow yourself to delete up to one word. Don't worry about the quality or accuracy of your writing – the goal is to get your thoughts down on paper and become a more confident writer.*
>
>*At the end of the 20 minutes, you'll be given a score based on how much time you spent typing (breaks of under 5 seconds aren't counted).*
>
>*Give it a try and see how much you can improve in just 20 minutes!*
